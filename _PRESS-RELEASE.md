There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

# How Popular Am I? #
  > This product is for users of friend- or follow-based social media, and will give consumers an idea of their popularity in context of other users' popularity.

## Summary ##
  > *How Popular Am I?* will give you an informed insight into your popularity on social media sites. By comparing your friends and followers with other consumers' friends and followers, you recieve context for how many people enjoy your social media presence and can factor that information in to your online presence thereafter.

## Problem ##
  > Any user of social media is familiar with the number of friends of followers they have on any particular site, but it's hard to obtain and understanding of what that number actually *means*. How many followers does the average Twitter user have? And how far is that number from the highest 5% of followers? It's difficult to understand your relative influence on social media sites.

## Solution ##
  > By obtaining data from any consumer of our product, we're able to compare data in a much more transparent process than any big-name social media company does. Our algorithms determine the bell curve of the amount of friends and followers and can provide our consumers information on their place within that bell curve, thus providing them with context as to their relative importance on the Internet.

## How Popular Am I? Speaks Up ##
  > "Processing and showing all of this data is really important," says K Strack-Grose, a senior developer at *How Popular Am I?*. "It's hard to obtain transparency from Facebook or Twitter or LinkedIn, and so what we're doing is really the best way to truly understand how unpopu--I mean, popular you are in comparison with your 'friends'."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Using our product is quick and simple. Just go to our website, howpopularami.com, and press the buttons that correspond to the social media sites you use. We'll process all of the information on our side, and show you your relative popularity!

## Testimonial ##
  > "I love *How Popular Am I?*", says Jessie N., a satisfied customer. "Before, I had no context as to how influential I was on Facebook. Now I know with surety that my aunt who posts only pictures of her dog is more influential than I am!"

## Conclusion ##
  > Think the app sounds great? Use it by going to [our website](http://howpopularami.com/ "How Popular Am I?"), or you can review our open-source algorithms on the [github repo](https://github.com/kstrack-grose/2015-06-mvp).
