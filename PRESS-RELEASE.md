# Popularit #
  > This product is for users of friend- or follow-based social media, and will give consumers an idea of their popularity in context of other users' popularity.

## Summary ##
  > *Popularit* is a product that will showcase the obsession that many people have on how their online presence is received by communicating a message that is wholly unbased on their online popularity.

## Problem ##
  > Social media is the communication of the past, present, and future, but we, as a society, are still figuring out how to interact with social media in a productive as well as entertaining way. The complaints of glamorizing or even falsifying information on profiles is perennial and stems from the pressure to present themselves as someone "interesting" as opposed to their genuine self.

## Solution ##
  > By creating persistant but mocked data, the application can gently point out the strangeness of obsessing over how one's online presence is recieved, as opposed to presenting oneself as authentically as possible. Perhaps, given enough thought and time, social media can become less glamorized and more authentic.

## Popularit Speaks Up ##
  > "My aunt only writes boastful posts and my first college roommate only writes really depressing posts," says Kiri Strack-Grose, creater of *Popularit*. "I'm interested in what drives these people to share only those things, and I think the best way to work toward a more authentic approach to social media is to faciliate introspection about how someone uses it.""
